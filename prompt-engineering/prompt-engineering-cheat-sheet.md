# Introduction
In-Context learning or famously known as prompt engineering requires zero updates in model paramaters. It is just an input to the model, prompt guides the model to activate the parameters in the part of the model that contains the correct information. In essence, prompting is instruction given to the model to perform any downstream task. It is straightforward way to solve any problem as it doesnâ€™t require expensive retraining of the model. Prompt engineering then would be the process of designing, templating, and refining a prompt to generate desired output from the model.
